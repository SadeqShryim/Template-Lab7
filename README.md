# Template --> Lab7

Write a template class ListOfKeysAndValues that has two template types.  Create a vector of each type.
Add a method for addKeyValuePair that accepts one of each template type, add them to the vector
Add a method getPair that accepts and index value and returns a pair of the two template types at that index
Add a method getValue that accepts a key value and returns the corresponding value paired with that key
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal Notes:
3 methods
    -addKeyValuePair
    -getValue() const;
    -getPair() const;

Allowed user to input the amout of pairs they would like to make and then asked them if they would like to 
  see the pairs that they created or end the program
